# CipherGuard Design Specifications

## Architecture

### Layered Design
- **GUI Layer**: tkinter interface with tabbed design
- **Logic Layer**: Email, VPN, and digital signature simulations
- **Data Layer**: Key management, message storage, logging
- **Integration Layer**: OpenSSL, GnuPG, Wireshark tools

## Core Components

### GUI (gui.py)
- Modern tkinter interface with responsive design
- Tabbed layout: Secure Communication, VPN, Digital Signatures, Storage
- Real-time feedback and status updates

### Email Simulation (email_sim.py)
- Hybrid RSA+AES encryption
- Digital signatures with RSA-PSS
- Key exchange and message authentication

### VPN Simulation (vpn_sim.py)
- SSL/TLS-like handshake simulation
- Session key generation and tunnel establishment
- Secure data transmission demonstration

### Digital Signatures (digital_signature.py)
- RSA-PSS with SHA-256 hashing
- Document signing and verification
- Public key management and storage

### Key Manager (key_manager.py)
- RSA-2048 key generation
- OAEP padding for encryption, PSS for signatures
- Secure in-memory key storage

### Cipher Engine (cipher.py)
- Hybrid encryption: RSA-OAEP + AES-256-GCM
- Authenticated encryption with integrity protection
- Base64 encoding for data transport

## Security Standards

### Cryptographic Algorithms
- **RSA**: 2048-bit keys with OAEP/PSS padding
- **AES**: 256-bit keys in GCM mode
- **Hashing**: SHA-256 for all operations
- **Random Generation**: Cryptographically secure

### Security Controls
- Memory cleanup after key operations
