This is a sample text document for testing CipherGuard's file encryption capabilities.

The document contains sensitive information that needs to be protected using advanced cryptographic methods.

Key features being tested:
- RSA public key encryption
- AES symmetric encryption for large data
- Digital signatures for integrity
- Secure key exchange protocols

This file could be encrypted using the CipherGuard system to demonstrate:
1. Confidentiality - Only authorized recipients can decrypt
2. Integrity - Any tampering will be detected
3. Authentication - Sender identity is verified
4. Non-repudiation - Sender cannot deny sending
